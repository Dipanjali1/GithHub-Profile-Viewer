# GitHub Profile Viewer

This is a simple HTML and PHP code that allows you to view a GitHub user's profile information. The code uses the GitHub API to fetch data for a specified GitHub username and displays it in a visually appealing container.

## Setup

Before using the code, you need to make a few modifications:

1. Replace `USERNAME` with the GitHub username of the profile you want to view.:
   ```php
   $githubUsername = "USERNAME";  //Enter the username here
2. Replace `API_Key` with the API Key :
   ```php
   $accessToken = "API_Key"; //Enter the API key with the required permissions and access
